        "He’s effective at resolving misunderstandings between clients and the team, though taking more time to understand technical limitations could improve his decisions.",
        "Petar runs efficient meetings, though occasionally the focus on minor details can detract from more critical discussions, causing the team to lose sight of priorities.",
        "His market knowledge is solid, but aligning product decisions more closely with the development team’s capabilities could lead to smoother execution.",
        "While Petar communicates well with clients, translating complex technical requirements to the development team could be improved to avoid misunderstandings and delays."
